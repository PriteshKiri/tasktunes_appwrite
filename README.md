[**Tasktunes**](https://tasktunes.net ) is a productivity application designed around the concept of the dopamine reward system and is built with [**Appwrite**](https://appwrite.io/) 


Its purpose is to assist users in achieving their goals and maintaining focus on their work.

The application features a built-in music player to create an ideal work environment, as well as a task manager that seamlessly syncs across all devices along with a Pomodoro timer to help you keep track of your time.

# ðŸŒŸ Features

The following are the **Key Highlights** of the application:
</br>

### 1. Lo-Fi Music Player: Help you to stay in focus mode

TaskTunes has a Lo-Fi music player feature that provides a selection of great Lo-Fi songs. Users can control the music through the audio player panel, allowing them to play, pause, skip, adjust volume, and mute. The intuitive song container enables playing or pausing songs from the list, and a shuffle option is available. This feature aims to help users maintain focus, aligning with TaskTunes' primary goal.


### 2. Pomodoro Timer: Helps you keep track of your time with a reward mechanism
Task Tunes includes a Pomodoro timer feature that helps users manage their time effectively. It offers three default timer buttons: a 5-minute rest timer, a 15-minute quick work timer, and a 25-minute focused work timer. Unlike traditional Pomodoro techniques, Task Tunes replaces the 15-minute long break with a 15-minute quick work option. Clicking the rest button activates the rest mode, while the other buttons initiate work mode. Users can also add a custom timer and select either "rest" or "work" mode, which determines the type of reward prompt displayed. The feature leverages the dopamine reward system to boost productivity and motivation.


### 3. Task Manager: Helps you seamlessly manage your tasks

Task Tunes includes a remarkable task manager as its third key feature. Users can easily add tasks and organize them by dragging and dropping into "Todos," "In Progress," or "Completed" containers. Deleting tasks is also simple, and the text input allows unlimited text without restrictions. The task manager features a convenient side navigation bar that shows pending task numbers, and hovering over icons provides task previews without opening the drawer. Additionally, a keyboard shortcut (double-tap "t") instantly opens the task manager for quick accessibility and efficient usage.
