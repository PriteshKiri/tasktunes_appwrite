        Dear <strong>Lo-Fi</strong> Lover 👋,

      <span>
        Welcome to <strong>TaskTunes</strong> , the one-stop tool to take your{" "}
        <strong>productivity</strong> to the next level 🚀
      </span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>
        Here, you can easily <strong>play, pause , and shuffle</strong> your
        Lo-Fi tracks, and adjust the<strong> volume</strong> or{" "}
        <strong>mute </strong>the audio with just one click.
      </span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>
        You can set the timer ⏱️ in <strong>three fixed ways</strong>, or even
        set a <strong>custom timer</strong> to fit your specific needs.Once the
        timer is activated, a <strong>charming animation</strong> on timer dial
        and a message tailored to the selected mode will be displayed at the
        bottom of the screen. In addition, the title of your{" "}
        <strong>browser tab</strong> will exhibit the timer.
      </span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>
        If the timer is set for five minutes or less, you'll be in{" "}
        <strong>rest </strong> mode, otherwise, you'll be in{" "}
        <strong>work</strong> mode.
      </span>
      <br />
      <br />
      <span>
        The key <strong>highlight</strong> of this tool is that it will notify
        you with a <strong>voice alert</strong> 📢 once the timer is over,
        reminding you to "rest" 🥤 or "get back to work" 💻 based on your timer
        mode.
