        Dear <strong>Lo-Fi</strong> Lover üëã,
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>TaskTunes</strong> , the one-stop tool to take your{" "}
        <strong>productivity</strong> to the next level üöÄ
      </p>
      <p>
        With the help of Lo-Fi music player you can easily{" "}
        <strong>play, pause , and shuffle</strong> your Lo-Fi tracks, and adjust
        the<strong> volume</strong> or <strong>mute </strong>the audio with just
        one click.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can set the timer ‚è±Ô∏è in <strong>three fixed ways</strong>, or even
        set a <strong>custom timer</strong> to fit your specific needs.Once the
        timer is activated, a <strong>charming animation</strong> on timer dial
        and a message tailored to the selected mode will be displayed at the
        bottom of the screen. In addition, the title of your{" "}
        <strong>browser tab</strong> will exhibit the timer.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the timer is set for five minutes or less, you'll be in{" "}
        <strong>rest </strong> mode, otherwise, you'll be in{" "}
        <strong>work</strong> mode, by default.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, you can add a <strong> custom timer </strong> and mode here.
        The timer feature operates on the{" "}
        <strong> dopamine reward system</strong>. When the timer in the{" "}
        <strong>rest mode</strong> ends, it displays a modal with an{" "}
        <strong>intuitive motivational quote</strong> that appears upon clicking
        the animation. The reward part comes into play when your{" "}
        <strong>work mode</strong> is completed, opening a modal with a{" "}
        <strong>gift</strong>
        that includes a relaxing exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Additionally, we have a <strong>Task Manager</strong>
        to efficiently handle your tasks. To view your tasks without opening the
        drawer, simply hover over the three small icons with numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        For quick access to the drawer, there is a <strong>shortcut</strong> .
        Double-tap on the <strong>"t"</strong> key to open it.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks for reading this guide till the end :)</p>
      <p>Happy hustling! üí™</p>
